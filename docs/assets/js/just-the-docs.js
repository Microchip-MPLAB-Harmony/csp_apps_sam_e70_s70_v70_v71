    "content": "This example application shows how to use the cache maintenance APIs to avoid issues related to cache coherency when the data cache is enabled. Application uses USART and the DMA PLIBs to demonstrate cache maintenance APIs provided by the Cache peripheral library. Applcation registers a callback with the DMA transmit and receive channels. It then transmits a message using the DMA transmit channel and then schedules a read of ten characters using the DMA receive channel. Once the DMA readis complete, it reads the received data and echoes the same on the terminal using the DMA transmit channel. Application calls DCACHE_CLEAN_BY_ADDR API on the write buffer before transmitting it. Calling this API copies the data from the cache memory to the main memory, thereby ensuring that the DMA peripheral uses the updated values in the write buffer. Application calls the DCACHE_INVALIDATE_BY_ADDR API on the read buffer after reception of data is complete by the DMA receive channel. Calling this API invalidates the cache region corresponding to the read buffer, thereby ensuring that the CPU reads updated values in the main memory into the read buffer (and into the cache memory). Cache maintenance operations are always performed on a cache line (1 cache line = 32 bytes), thus the read and write buffers must be aligned to a 32 byte boundary and must be a multiple of 32 bytes. This is the reason why 32 byte buffers are used for receiving and echoing 10 bytes of data. ",

DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to transmit data from pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer. When DMA is receiving data to ping buffer, CPU works on pong buffer. When DMA completes transfer, it generates an interrupt to indicate the availability of data in the ping buffer. DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to receive data in the pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer. Data is transmitted and received in loopback mode by shorting the MISO and MOSI lines. At the end of transfer, received data is compared with transmitted data to confirm data match. ",

    "content": "This example application shows how to use the data TCM to ensure a high-speed, low latency, and deterministic access to data.TCM is a memory accessed by a dedicated connection from the core. Access to the TCM memory is at full processor clock speed and can be accessed both by the CPU and the DMA. TCM provides deterministic behavior as it does not suffer from cache hit and cache miss. There is no explicit or extra memory for TCM. It is the internal SRAM of the microcontroller that gets partitioned as TCM + SRAM. This application uses the USART and the DMA PLIBs to demonstrate the TCM usage. It registers a callback with the DMA transmit and receive channels. Application first transmits a message using DMA transmit channel and then schedules a read of ten characters using the DMA receive channel. Once the DMA read is complete, it reads the received data and echoes the same on the terminal using the DMA transmit channel. Unlike the cache maintenance APIs, using the TCM does not pose restrictions on aligning the read and write buffers to a 32-byte boundary with a size that is a multiple of 32 bytes. An XC32 compiler attribute can be used to place the read and write buffers into the TCM memory region to avoid the issues related to cache coherency when the DMA is used with the data cache enabled.

    "content": "This example uses the TWIHS peripheral library in slave mode and emulates an EEPROM of 512 bytes. There are two pages each of size 256 bytes. TWIHS slave expects two bytes of memory address from the TWIHS master and the memory address can range from 0x00 to 0x1FF. TWIHS slave application supports following: . Byte Write: The TWIHS master sends the slave address, followed by two bytes of memory address. The slave provides the data present at the requested memory address. Page Write: A page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the TWIHS master can write up-to 256 bytes (1 page). If more than 256 bytes are sent by the TWIHS master to the TWIHS slave, the memory address will “roll over” and previous data will be overwritten. The address “roll over” during write is from the last byte of the current page to the first byte of the same page. Current Address Read: The internal memory address counter maintains the last address accessed during the last read or write operation, incremented by one. Once the device address with the read/write bit set to one is clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, the data byte at the current address is serially clocked out. After reading the data from the current address, the TWIHS master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. Random Read: The TWIHS master writes the 2 byte memory address and then reads the data from that memory address. After reading the data, the TWIHS master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. Sequential Read: Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a random address read. As long as the EEPROM receives an acknowledge, it will continue to increment the memory address and serially clock out sequential data bytes. When the memory address limit is reached (0x1FF), the memory address will “roll over” to 0x00 and the sequential read will continue. The sequential read operation is terminated when the TWIHS master sends a NAK and generates a STOP condition. To run the application, two evaluation kits will be required - one acting as the TWIHS master and the other as the TWIHS slave. The TWIHS master application to be used for this demo application is available under apps/twihs/master/twihs_eeprom/firmware folder. TWIHS master writes an array of values to the TWIHS slave and verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written. ",

The number of cycles taken for the transfer is measured using the System timer/Periodic Interval Timer (SysTick/PIT) to illustrate how the burst size helps to reduces the transfer time. This example also demonstrates cache maintenance operation by cleaning and invalidating cache for the buffers located in cacheable memory. The buffers are aligned to cache line and its size is an integer multiple of the cache line size. Cache line(s) for source buffer range is cleaned before submitting a transfer request to DMA to load the latest data in the cache to the RAM (SRAM/DDR). Cache line(s) for destination buffer address range is invalidated to ensure that the CPU reads the latest data from the RAM (SRAM/DDR). ",
