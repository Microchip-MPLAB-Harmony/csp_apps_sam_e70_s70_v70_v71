# PIO interrupt

This example shows how to generate GPIO interrupt on switch press and release, and indicate the switch status using the LED.

## Description

This application uses the PIO Peripheral library to generate callback on switch press and release, and drives the GPIO pin connected to the LED to indicate the switch status. The LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the switch is released.
