# QSPI flash read write in SPI mode

This example shows how to use the QSPI Peripheral library to perform erase, write and read operation with the QSPI Serial Flash memory in SPI mode.

## Description

This example uses the QSPI peripheral library to erase and write an array of values to the SPI Serial Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.
