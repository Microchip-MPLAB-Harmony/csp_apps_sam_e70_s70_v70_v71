# QSPI flash read write

This example shows how to use the QSPI Peripheral library to perform erase, write and read operation with the QSPI Serial Flash memory in Quad IO mode.

## Description

This example uses the QSPI peripheral library to erase and write an array of values to the QSPI Serial Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. LED indicates success or failure:
    - The LED is toggled when the value read from the QSPI Serial Flash memory matched with the written value
    - The LED is turned ON when the value read from the QSPI Serial Flash did not match with the written value

The following table provides the LED name

| Board      | LED name |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)    | LED1 |
| [SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamv71-xult)      | LED0 |
