# Embedded Flash Controller flash read write example (flash_read_write)

This example application demonstrates how to use the EFC to erase and program the internal Flash memory.

## Description

This example uses the EFC peripheral library to erase a row and write an array of values to the internal Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.
