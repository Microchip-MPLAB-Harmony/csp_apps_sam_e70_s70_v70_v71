# True Random Number Generator (TRNG) application example (random_number)

This example application shows how to use the TRNG Peripheral library to generate and read a random number.

## Description

This example application shows how to use the TRNG peripheral library to produce a 32-bit true random number. Generated random number can be used as an entropy source for seeding a Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRNG), creating cryptographic keys for ciphers etc.
