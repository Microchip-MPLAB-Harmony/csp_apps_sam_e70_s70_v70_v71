# USART interrupt

This example shows how to use the USART peripheral to transfer a block of data in a non-blocking manner.

## Description

This example shows the read and write operation over a UART in a non-blocking manner. The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer. It receives 10 characters from the terminal window and echoes them back.
