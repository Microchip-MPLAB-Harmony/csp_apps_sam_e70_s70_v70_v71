# SPI ping pong with dma example (spi_ping_pong_with_dma)

This example demonstrates how to continuously transmit and receive data over a SPI interface using ping pong buffers with the DMA.

## Description

DMA peripheral provides support to implement ping-pong buffering. DMA transmits and receives data from one pair of buffers, when CPU works on the second pair.

When DMA is transmitting data from ping buffer, CPU works on pong buffer. When DMA completes transfer, it generates an interrupt to indicate transfer completion from ping buffer. DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to transmit data from pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer.

When DMA is receiving data to ping buffer, CPU works on pong buffer. When DMA completes transfer, it generates an interrupt to indicate the availability of data in the ping buffer. DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to receive data in the pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer.

Data is transmitted and received in loopback mode by shorting the MISO and MOSI lines. At the end of transfer, received data is compared with transmitted data to confirm data match.

### Setting up [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)

- Use a jumper wire to short pin 16 and pin 17 of the EXT1 header
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Setting up [SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamv71-xult)

- Use a jumper wire to short pin 16 and pin 17 of the EXT1 header
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application project using its respective IDE
2. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - The LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

The following table provides the LED name.

| Board      | LED |
