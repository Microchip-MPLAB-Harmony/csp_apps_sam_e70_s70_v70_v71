# SPI self loopback data transfer in interrupt mode example (spi_self_loopback_interrupt)

This example application demonstrates how to use the SPI peripheral to transmit and receive a block of data using interrupts.

## Description

This example demonstrates transmit and receive operation over SPI interface in a non-blocking manner using interrupts. It transmits known values from an array and verifies the data received through loop back by comparing both.
The example application performs the loop back test only once after a power on reset. After the loop back is complete, the status of the loop back is indicated and the application remains idle.
The loop back test requires the MOSI output pin to be connected to the MISO input pin so that anything transmitted will also be received.

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application project using its respective IDE
2. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - The LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

The following table provides the LED name.
